# Spring Boot REST API - Learning Project

This project is created as part of a hands-on learning experience to understand how to build RESTful APIs using the Spring Boot framework.

The main focus of the project is to explore the key concepts and components involved in backend development with Java, including:

- **Spring MVC** for building controller-service-repository architecture
- **REST API** principles for building stateless, client-server APIs
- **Hibernate (JPA)** for object-relational mapping between Java classes and a relational database
- **PostgreSQL** as the relational database management system for persistent data storage
- **Postman** for testing and interacting with the API endpoints during development.

The project serves as a foundational exercise for mastering the development of modern Java-based web services using clean coding practices and layered architecture.
